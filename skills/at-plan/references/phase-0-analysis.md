# Phase 0: codebase analysis

Skip Phase 0 when the codebase is unchanged since the last sprint, when the session continues earlier work, or for a small bug fix. Otherwise run the roster analyst over the full repository with the `codebase-analyst` agent definition, then read the updated `ops/` files after it completes.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
ROOT=$(bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/locate-triforge.sh") || exit $?
source "$ROOT/scripts/invoke-external.sh"

# Full codebase analysis (uses the codebase-analyst agent definition)
AGY_OUT="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/antigravity_phase0_$$_$(date +%s).txt"
AGY_RC=0
invoke_antigravity "codebase-analyst" \
  "Analyze the full codebase. Write to ops/ARCHITECTURE.md, ops/MEMORY.md (append), ops/CONTRACTS.md (append) if you can; otherwise return the complete content as your response, sectioned per target file." \
  "$AGY_OUT" 600 || AGY_RC=$?
if [ "$AGY_RC" -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "phase0: codebase-analyst failed rc=$AGY_RC (see $AGY_OUT, ${AGY_OUT}.err) — continuing without a fresh ARCHITECTURE.md" >&2
fi

# Promotion guard (KTD2/D-032): promote captured agy output only when it is
# non-empty prose AND the JSON-envelope status sidecar written by
# invoke_antigravity reads SUCCESS (a denied/empty run leaves the file empty and
# returns non-zero — nothing is promoted, AE2). A non-agy roster lane writes no
# sidecar and is promoted on non-empty output as before. The header records the
# resolved mode (injection|native|raw) and any denied actions so a degraded run
# is attributable in the promoted file.
if [ ! -f "ops/ARCHITECTURE.md" ] && [ -s "$AGY_OUT" ] && { [ ! -f "${AGY_OUT}.status" ] || [ "$(cat "${AGY_OUT}.status")" = "SUCCESS" ]; }; then
  {
    echo "<!-- captured from codebase-analyst output; agent could not write ops/ directly (headless permission auto-deny); mode=$(cat "${AGY_OUT}.mode" 2>/dev/null || echo unknown); denied_actions=$([ -s "${AGY_OUT}.denied" ] && paste -sd, "${AGY_OUT}.denied" || echo none) -->"
    _scrub < "$AGY_OUT"
